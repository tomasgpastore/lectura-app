        "rawText": "# E\nmust get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly  \nnicknamed it \u201cThiel\u2019s law\u201d: .\n_a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed_  \nBeginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes\nafterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the  \n\u2014a\nearliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 10 [30]\nmillion trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few\nmoments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today.  \nIt was also true 227 years ago at the founding of our country: fundamental\nquestions were open for debate by the Framers during the few months they spent\ntogether at the Constitutional Convention. How much power should the central\ngovernment have? How should representation in Congress be apportioned? Whatever\nyour views on the compromises reached that summer in Philadelphia, they\u2019ve been\nhard to change ever since: after ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791, we\u2019ve amended\nthe Constitution only 17 times. Today, California has the same representation in the\nSenate as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times as many people. Maybe\nthat\u2019s a feature, not a bug. But we\u2019re probably stuck with it as long as the United\nStates exists. Another constitutional convention is unlikely; today we debate only\nsmaller questions.  \nCompanies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on\u2014if you\nchoose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example\u2014are very hard to\ncorrect after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before\nanybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first\nthings right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.",

        "rawText": "_Zero to One_ is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on\neverything I\u2019ve learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an\ninvestor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have\nnoticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for\nsuccess. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily\ncannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe\nin concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I\nhave noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do\nthis by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.  \nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012.\nCollege students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never\nlearn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching\nthe class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic\nspecialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake\nMasters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in  \n_Zero to One_ I have worked with him to revise the notes for a wider audience. There\u2019s  \nno reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon\nValley.",

        "rawText": "This\nhints at the strange way in which the companies that create new technology often\nresemble feudal monarchies rather than organizations that are supposedly more\n\u201cmodern.\u201d A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong\npersonal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal\nbureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but\nthey usually act with short time horizons.  \nThe lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more\ntolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to\nlead companies beyond mere incrementalism.  \nThe lesson for founders is that individual prominence and adulation can never be\nenjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety\nand demonization at any moment\u2014so be careful.  \nAbove all, don\u2019t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are\nimportant not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather\nbecause a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company.\nThat we need individual founders in all their peculiarity does not mean that we are\ncalled to worship Ayn Randian \u201cprime movers\u201d who claim to be independent of\neverybody around them. In this respect Rand was a merely half-great writer: her\nvillains were real, but her heroes were fake. There is no Galt\u2019s Gulch. There is no  \nsecession from society. To believe yourself invested with divine self-sufficiency is not\nthe mark of a strong individual, but of a person who has mistaken the crowd\u2019s\nworship\u2014or jeering\u2014for the truth. The single greatest danger for a founder is to\nbecome so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious\ndanger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for  \nwisdom.",

It does matter what you do. You\nshould focus relentlessly on something you\u2019re good at doing, but before that you  \nmust think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.  \nFor the startup world, this means you should not necessarily start your own\ncompany, even if you are extraordinarily talented.

It\u2019s not a secret.  \nRemember our contrarian question: _what important truth do very few people agree_\n_with you on?_ If we already understand as much of the natural world as we ever will\n\u2014if all of today\u2019s conventional ideas are already enlightened, and if everything has\nalready been done\u2014then there are no good answers. Contrarian thinking doesn\u2019t\nmake any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.  \nOf course, there are many things we don\u2019t yet understand, but some of those\nthings may be impossible to figure out\u2014mysteries rather than secrets. For example,\nstring theory describes the physics of the universe in terms of vibrating onedimensional objects called \u201cstrings.\u201d Is string theory true? You can\u2019t really design\nexperiments to test it. Very few people, if any, could ever understand all its\nimplications. But is that just because it\u2019s difficult? Or is it an impossible mystery?\nThe difference matters. You can achieve difficult things, but you can\u2019t achieve the\nimpossible.  \nRecall the business version of our contrarian question: _what valuable company is_\n_nobody building?_ Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important\nand unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the  \nworld, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started. This\nchapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.",

        "rawText": "Focus on product, not sales  \nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good\nenough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\nBubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth\nis viral growth.  \nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore\nthem are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great\ncrash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:  \n_1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality._  \n_2. A bad plan is better than no plan._  \n_3. Competitive markets destroy profits._  \n_4. Sales matters just as much as product._  \nIt\u2019s true that there was a bubble in technology. The late \u201990s was a time of hubris:\npeople believed in going from 0 to 1. Too few startups were actually getting there,\nand many never went beyond talking about it. But people understood that we had no\nchoice but to find ways to do more with less. The market high of March 2000 was\nobviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of\nclarity. People looked far into the future, saw how much valuable new technology\nwe would need to get there safely, and judged themselves capable of creating it.  \nWe still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and\nexuberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon\nthe dogmas created after the crash. That doesn\u2019t mean the opposite ideas are\nautomatically true: you can\u2019t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting\nthem. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by  \nmistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose\nthe crowd but to think for yourself.",
