He started PayPal in 1998, led it as CEO,\nand took it public in 2002, defining a new era of fast and secure online commerce. In\n2004 he made the first outside investment in Facebook, where he serves as a director.  \nThe same year he launched Palantir Technologies, a software company that\nharnesses computers to empower human analysts in fields like national security and\nglobal finance. He has provided early funding for LinkedIn, Yelp, and dozens of\nsuccessful technology startups, many run by former colleagues who have been\ndubbed the \u201cPayPal Mafia.\u201d He is a partner at Founders Fund, a Silicon Valley\nventure capital firm that has funded companies like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started\nthe Thiel Fellowship, which ignited a national debate by encouraging young people\nto put learning before schooling, and he leads the Thiel Foundation, which works to\nadvance technological progress and long-term thinking about the future.  \n**Blake Masters** was a student at Stanford Law School in 2012 when his detailed notes on  \nPeter\u2019s class \u201cComputer Science 183: Startup\u201d became an internet sensation. He\nwent on to co-found Judicata, a legal research technology startup."

        "text": "# E\nmust get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly  \nnicknamed it \u201cThiel\u2019s law\u201d: .\n_a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed_  \nBeginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes\nafterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the  \n\u2014a\nearliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 10 [30]\nmillion trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few\nmoments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today.  \nIt was also true 227 years ago at the founding of our country: fundamental\nquestions were open for debate by the Framers during the few months they spent\ntogether at the Constitutional Convention. How much power should the central\ngovernment have? How should representation in Congress be apportioned? Whatever\nyour views on the compromises reached that summer in Philadelphia, they\u2019ve been\nhard to change ever since: after ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791, we\u2019ve amended\nthe Constitution only 17 times. Today, California has the same representation in the\nSenate as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times as many people. Maybe\nthat\u2019s a feature, not a bug. But we\u2019re probably stuck with it as long as the United\nStates exists. Another constitutional convention is unlikely; today we debate only\nsmaller questions.  \nCompanies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on\u2014if you\nchoose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example\u2014are very hard to\ncorrect after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before\nanybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first\nthings right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation."

        "text": "Focus on product, not sales  \nIf your product requires advertising or salespeople to sell it, it\u2019s not good\nenough: technology is primarily about product development, not distribution.\nBubble-era advertising was obviously wasteful, so the only sustainable growth\nis viral growth.  \nThese lessons have become dogma in the startup world; those who would ignore\nthem are presumed to invite the justified doom visited upon technology in the great\ncrash of 2000. And yet the opposite principles are probably more correct:  \n_1. It is better to risk boldness than triviality._  \n_2. A bad plan is better than no plan._  \n_3. Competitive markets destroy profits._  \n_4. Sales matters just as much as product._  \nIt\u2019s true that there was a bubble in technology. The late \u201990s was a time of hubris:\npeople believed in going from 0 to 1. Too few startups were actually getting there,\nand many never went beyond talking about it. But people understood that we had no\nchoice but to find ways to do more with less. The market high of March 2000 was\nobviously a peak of insanity; less obvious but more important, it was also a peak of\nclarity. People looked far into the future, saw how much valuable new technology\nwe would need to get there safely, and judged themselves capable of creating it.  \nWe still need new technology, and we may even need some 1999-style hubris and\nexuberance to get it. To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon\nthe dogmas created after the crash. That doesn\u2019t mean the opposite ideas are\nautomatically true: you can\u2019t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting\nthem. Instead ask yourself: how much of what you know about business is shaped by  \nmistaken reactions to past mistakes? The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose\nthe crowd but to think for yourself."

From the Founding\nFathers in politics to the Royal Society in science to Fairchild Semiconductor\u2019s\n\u201ctraitorous eight\u201d in business, small groups of people bound together by a sense of\nmission have changed the world for the better. The easiest explanation for this is\nnegative: it\u2019s hard to develop new things in big organizations, and it\u2019s even harder to\ndo it by yourself. Bureaucratic hierarchies move slowly, and entrenched interests shy\naway from risk. In the most dysfunctional organizations, signaling that work is being\ndone becomes a better strategy for career advancement than actually doing work (if\nthis describes your company, you should quit now). At the other extreme, a lone\ngenius might create a classic work of art or literature, but he could never create an\nentire industry. Startups operate on the principle that you need to work with other\npeople to get stuff done, but you also need to stay small enough so that you actually  \ncan.  \nPositively defined, a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a\nplan to build a different future. A new company\u2019s most important strength is new\nthinking: even more important than nimbleness, small size affords space to think.\nThis book is about the questions you must ask and answer to succeed in the business\nof doing new things: what follows is not a manual or a record of knowledge but an\nexercise in thinking. Because that is what a startup has to do: question received ideas  \nand rethink business from scratch."

        "text": "_Zero to One_ is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on\neverything I\u2019ve learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an\ninvestor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have\nnoticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for\nsuccess. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily\ncannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe\nin concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I\nhave noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do\nthis by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.  \nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012.\nCollege students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never\nlearn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching\nthe class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic\nspecialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake\nMasters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in  \n_Zero to One_ I have worked with him to revise the notes for a wider audience. There\u2019s  \nno reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon\nValley."

It does matter what you do. You\nshould focus relentlessly on something you\u2019re good at doing, but before that you  \nmust think hard about whether it will be valuable in the future.  \nFor the startup world, this means you should not necessarily start your own\ncompany, even if you are extraordinarily talented. If anything, too many people are  \nstarting their own companies today. People who understand the power law will\nhesitate more than others when it comes to founding a new venture: they know how\ntremendously successful they could become by joining the very best company while\nit\u2019s growing fast. The power law means that differences _between_ companies will\ndwarf the differences in roles _inside_ companies. You could have 100% of the equity\nif you fully fund your own venture, but if it fails you\u2019ll have 100% of nothing.\nOwning just 0.01% of Google, by contrast, is incredibly valuable (more than $35\nmillion as of this writing).  \nIf you do start your own company, you must remember the power law to operate\nit well. The most important things are singular: One market will probably be better\nthan all others, as we discussed in Chapter 5. One distribution strategy usually\ndominates all others, too\u2014for that see Chapter 11. Time and decision-making\nthemselves follow a power law, and some moments matter far more than others\u2014  \nsee\nChapter 9. However, you can\u2019t trust a world that denies the power law to\naccurately frame your decisions for you, so what\u2019s most important is rarely obvious.\nIt might even be secret. But in a power law world, you can\u2019t afford not to think hard\nabout where your actions will fall on the curve."
