        "rawText": "# E\nmust get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly  \nnicknamed it \u201cThiel\u2019s law\u201d: .\n_a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed_  \nBeginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes\nafterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the  \n\u2014a\nearliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 10 [30]\nmillion trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few\nmoments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today.  \nIt was also true 227 years ago at the founding of our country: fundamental\nquestions were open for debate by the Framers during the few months they spent\ntogether at the Constitutional Convention. How much power should the central\ngovernment have? How should representation in Congress be apportioned? Whatever\nyour views on the compromises reached that summer in Philadelphia, they\u2019ve been\nhard to change ever since: after ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791, we\u2019ve amended\nthe Constitution only 17 times. Today, California has the same representation in the\nSenate as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times as many people. Maybe\nthat\u2019s a feature, not a bug. But we\u2019re probably stuck with it as long as the United\nStates exists. Another constitutional convention is unlikely; today we debate only\nsmaller questions.  \nCompanies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on\u2014if you\nchoose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example\u2014are very hard to\ncorrect after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before\nanybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first\nthings right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation.",

        "rawText": "_Zero to One_ is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on\neverything I\u2019ve learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an\ninvestor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have\nnoticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for\nsuccess. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily\ncannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe\nin concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I\nhave noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do\nthis by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.  \nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012.\nCollege students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never\nlearn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching\nthe class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic\nspecialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake\nMasters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in  \n_Zero to One_ I have worked with him to revise the notes for a wider audience. There\u2019s  \nno reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon\nValley.",

        "rawText": "This\nhints at the strange way in which the companies that create new technology often\nresemble feudal monarchies rather than organizations that are supposedly more\n\u201cmodern.\u201d A unique founder can make authoritative decisions, inspire strong\npersonal loyalty, and plan ahead for decades. Paradoxically, impersonal\nbureaucracies staffed by trained professionals can last longer than any lifetime, but\nthey usually act with short time horizons.  \nThe lesson for business is that we need founders. If anything, we should be more\ntolerant of founders who seem strange or extreme; we need unusual individuals to\nlead companies beyond mere incrementalism.  \nThe lesson for founders is that individual prominence and adulation can never be\nenjoyed except on the condition that it may be exchanged for individual notoriety\nand demonization at any moment\u2014so be careful.  \nAbove all, don\u2019t overestimate your own power as an individual. Founders are\nimportant not because they are the only ones whose work has value, but rather\nbecause a great founder can bring out the best work from everybody at his company.\nThat we need individual founders in all their peculiarity does not mean that we are\ncalled to worship Ayn Randian \u201cprime movers\u201d who claim to be independent of\neverybody around them. In this respect Rand was a merely half-great writer: her\nvillains were real, but her heroes were fake. There is no Galt\u2019s Gulch. There is no  \nsecession from society. To believe yourself invested with divine self-sufficiency is not\nthe mark of a strong individual, but of a person who has mistaken the crowd\u2019s\nworship\u2014or jeering\u2014for the truth. The single greatest danger for a founder is to\nbecome so certain of his own myth that he loses his mind. But an equally insidious\ndanger for every business is to lose all sense of myth and mistake disenchantment for  \nwisdom.",

It does matter what you do.

Contrarian thinking doesn\u2019t\nmake any sense unless the world still has secrets left to give up.  \nOf course, there are many things we don\u2019t yet understand, but some of those\nthings may be impossible to figure out\u2014mysteries rather than secrets. For example,\nstring theory describes the physics of the universe in terms of vibrating onedimensional objects called \u201cstrings.\u201d Is string theory true? You can\u2019t really design\nexperiments to test it. Very few people, if any, could ever understand all its\nimplications. But is that just because it\u2019s difficult? Or is it an impossible mystery?\nThe difference matters. You can achieve difficult things, but you can\u2019t achieve the\nimpossible.  \nRecall the business version of our contrarian question: _what valuable company is_\n_nobody building?_ Every correct answer is necessarily a secret: something important\nand unknown, something hard to do but doable. If there are many secrets left in the  \nworld, there are probably many world-changing companies yet to be started. This\nchapter will help you think about secrets and how to find them.",

To build the next generation of companies, we must abandon\nthe dogmas created after the crash. That doesn\u2019t mean the opposite ideas are\nautomatically true: you can\u2019t escape the madness of crowds by dogmatically rejecting\nthem.

Actually, there\u2019s no evidence that Einstein ever\nsaid any of those things\u2014the quotations are all apocryphal. But this very\nmisattribution reinforces the message: having invested the principal of a lifetime\u2019s\nbrilliance, Einstein continues to earn interest on it from beyond the grave by\nreceiving credit for things he never said.  \nMost sayings are forgotten. At the other extreme, a select few people like Einstein\nand Shakespeare are constantly quoted and ventriloquized. We shouldn\u2019t be\nsurprised, since small minorities often achieve disproportionate results. In 1906,\neconomist Vilfredo Pareto discovered what became the \u201cPareto principle,\u201d or the 8020 rule, when he noticed that 20% of the people owned 80% of the land in Italy\u2014a\nphenomenon that he found just as natural as the fact that 20% of the peapods in his\ngarden produced 80% of the peas. This extraordinarily stark pattern, in which a\nsmall few radically outstrip all rivals, surrounds us everywhere in the natural and\nsocial world. The most destructive earthquakes are many times more powerful than\nall smaller earthquakes combined. The biggest cities dwarf all mere towns put\ntogether. And monopoly businesses capture more value than millions of\nundifferentiated competitors. Whatever Einstein did or didn\u2019t say, the power law\u2014\nso named because exponential equations describe severely unequal distributions\u2014is\nthe law of the universe.

        "rawText": "### THE CASE FOR SECRETS  \nYou can\u2019t find secrets without looking for them. Andrew Wiles demonstrated this\nwhen he proved Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem after 358 years of fruitless inquiry by other\nmathematicians\u2014the kind of sustained failure that might have suggested an\ninherently impossible task. Pierre de Fermat had conjectured in 1637 that no\nintegers _a,_ _b,_ and _c_ could satisfy the equation _a_ _[n]_ + _b_ _[n]_ = _c_ _[n]_ for any integer _n_ greater\nthan 2. He claimed to have a proof, but he died without writing it down, so his\nconjecture long remained a major unsolved problem in mathematics. Wiles started\nworking on it in 1986, but he kept it a secret until 1993, when he knew he was\nnearing a solution. After nine years of hard work, Wiles proved the conjecture in\n1995. He needed brilliance to succeed, but he also needed a faith in secrets. If you\nthink something hard is impossible, you\u2019ll never even start trying to achieve it. Belief  \nin secrets is an effective truth.  \nThe actual truth is that there are many more secrets left to find, but they will\nyield only to relentless searchers. There is more to do in science, medicine,\nengineering, and in technology of all kinds. We are within reach not just of marginal\ngoals set at the competitive edge of today\u2019s conventional disciplines, but of ambitions\nso great that even the boldest minds of the Scientific Revolution hesitated to\nannounce them directly. We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age\nand metabolic decay. We can find new ways to generate energy that free the world\nfrom conflict over fossil fuels. We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place\nover the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle\nnew frontiers. But we will never learn any of these secrets unless we demand to  \nknow them and force ourselves to look.  \nThe same is true of business. Great companies can be built on open but\nunsuspected secrets about how the world works.",
