    "response": "Peter Thiel, with Blake Masters, emphasizes the critical importance of a startup's foundation. They express this with what friends teasingly call \"Thiel's law\": \"a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed\" [^4]. Thiel and Masters believe founders need to get the first things right because a great company cannot be built on a flawed foundation [^4].",

He started PayPal in 1998, led it as CEO,\nand took it public in 2002, defining a new era of fast and secure online commerce. In\n2004 he made the first outside investment in Facebook, where he serves as a director.  \nThe same year he launched Palantir Technologies, a software company that\nharnesses computers to empower human analysts in fields like national security and\nglobal finance. He has provided early funding for LinkedIn, Yelp, and dozens of\nsuccessful technology startups, many run by former colleagues who have been\ndubbed the \u201cPayPal Mafia.\u201d He is a partner at Founders Fund, a Silicon Valley\nventure capital firm that has funded companies like SpaceX and Airbnb. He started\nthe Thiel Fellowship, which ignited a national debate by encouraging young people\nto put learning before schooling, and he leads the Thiel Foundation, which works to\nadvance technological progress and long-term thinking about the future.  \n**Blake Masters** was a student at Stanford Law School in 2012 when his detailed notes on  \nPeter\u2019s class \u201cComputer Science 183: Startup\u201d became an internet sensation. He\nwent on to co-found Judicata, a legal research technology startup."

        "text": "# E\nmust get right at the beginning. I stress this so often that friends have teasingly  \nnicknamed it \u201cThiel\u2019s law\u201d: .\n_a startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed_  \nBeginnings are special. They are qualitatively different from all that comes\nafterward. This was true 13.8 billion years ago, at the founding of our cosmos: in the  \n\u2014a\nearliest microseconds of its existence, the universe expanded by a factor of 10 [30]\nmillion trillion trillion. As cosmogonic epochs came and went in those first few\nmoments, the very laws of physics were different from those we know today.  \nIt was also true 227 years ago at the founding of our country: fundamental\nquestions were open for debate by the Framers during the few months they spent\ntogether at the Constitutional Convention. How much power should the central\ngovernment have? How should representation in Congress be apportioned? Whatever\nyour views on the compromises reached that summer in Philadelphia, they\u2019ve been\nhard to change ever since: after ratifying the Bill of Rights in 1791, we\u2019ve amended\nthe Constitution only 17 times. Today, California has the same representation in the\nSenate as Alaska, even though it has more than 50 times as many people. Maybe\nthat\u2019s a feature, not a bug. But we\u2019re probably stuck with it as long as the United\nStates exists. Another constitutional convention is unlikely; today we debate only\nsmaller questions.  \nCompanies are like countries in this way. Bad decisions made early on\u2014if you\nchoose the wrong partners or hire the wrong people, for example\u2014are very hard to\ncorrect after they are made. It may take a crisis on the order of bankruptcy before\nanybody will even try to correct them. As a founder, your first job is to get the first\nthings right, because you cannot build a great company on a flawed foundation."

John Rawls will need to be displaced in philosophy departments.\nMalcolm Gladwell must be persuaded to change his theories. And pollsters have to\nbe driven from politics. But the philosophy professors and the Gladwells of the world\nare set in their ways, to say nothing of our politicians. It\u2019s extremely hard to make\nchanges in those crowded fields, even with brains and good intentions.  \nA startup is the largest endeavor over which you can have definite mastery.

        "text": "_Zero to One_ is about how to build companies that create new things. It draws on\neverything I\u2019ve learned directly as a co-founder of PayPal and Palantir and then an\ninvestor in hundreds of startups, including Facebook and SpaceX. But while I have\nnoticed many patterns, and I relate them here, this book offers no formula for\nsuccess. The paradox of teaching entrepreneurship is that such a formula necessarily\ncannot exist; because every innovation is new and unique, no authority can prescribe\nin concrete terms how to be innovative. Indeed, the single most powerful pattern I\nhave noticed is that successful people find value in unexpected places, and they do\nthis by thinking about business from first principles instead of formulas.  \nThis book stems from a course about startups that I taught at Stanford in 2012.\nCollege students can become extremely skilled at a few specialties, but many never\nlearn what to do with those skills in the wider world. My primary goal in teaching\nthe class was to help my students see beyond the tracks laid down by academic\nspecialties to the broader future that is theirs to create. One of those students, Blake\nMasters, took detailed class notes, which circulated far beyond the campus, and in  \n_Zero to One_ I have worked with him to revise the notes for a wider audience. There\u2019s  \nno reason why the future should happen only at Stanford, or in college, or in Silicon\nValley."

        "text": "### FOUNDING MATRIMONY  \nWhen you start something, the first and most crucial decision you make is whom to\nstart it with. Choosing a co-founder is like getting married, and founder conflict is\njust as ugly as divorce. Optimism abounds at the start of every relationship. It\u2019s\nunromantic to think soberly about what could go wrong, so people don\u2019t. But if the\nfounders develop irreconcilable differences, the company becomes the victim.  \nIn 1999, Luke Nosek was one of my co-founders at PayPal, and I still work with\nhim today at Founders Fund. But a year before PayPal, I invested in a company\nLuke started with someone else. It was his first startup; it was one of my first\ninvestments. Neither of us realized it then, but the venture was doomed to fail from  \nthe beginning because Luke and his co-founder were a terrible match. Luke is a\nbrilliant and eccentric thinker; his co-founder was an MBA type who didn\u2019t want to\nmiss out on the \u201990s gold rush. They met at a networking event, talked for a while,\nand decided to start a company together. That\u2019s no better than marrying the first\nperson you meet at the slot machines in Vegas: you _might_ hit the jackpot, but it\nprobably won\u2019t work. Their company blew up and I lost my money.  \nNow when I consider investing in a startup, I study the founding teams. Technical\nabilities and complementary skill sets matter, but how well the founders know each\nother and how well they work together matter just as much. Founders should share a\nprehistory before they start a company together\u2014otherwise they\u2019re just rolling dice."

        "text": "### BEYOND PROFESSIONALISM  \nThe first team that I built has become known in Silicon Valley as the \u201cPayPal\nMafia\u201d because so many of my former colleagues have gone on to help each other\nstart and invest in successful tech companies. We sold PayPal to eBay for $1.5 billion\nin 2002. Since then, Elon Musk has founded SpaceX and co-founded Tesla Motors;\nReid Hoffman co-founded LinkedIn; Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim\ntogether founded YouTube; Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons founded Yelp;\nDavid Sacks co-founded Yammer; and I co-founded Palantir. Today all seven of\nthose companies are worth more than $1 billion each. PayPal\u2019s office amenities\nnever got much press, but the team has done extraordinarily well, both together and\nindividually: the culture was strong enough to transcend the original company.  \nWe didn\u2019t assemble a mafia by sorting through r\u00e9sum\u00e9s and simply hiring the\nmost talented people. I had seen the mixed results of that approach firsthand when I\nworked at a New York law firm. The lawyers I worked with ran a valuable business,\nand they were impressive individuals one by one. But the relationships between\nthem were oddly thin. They spent all day together, but few of them seemed to have\nmuch to say to each other outside the office. Why work with a group of people who\ndon\u2019t even like each other? Many seem to think it\u2019s a sacrifice necessary for making\nmoney. But taking a merely professional view of the workplace, in which free agents\ncheck in and out on a transactional basis, is worse than cold: it\u2019s not even rational.\nSince time is your most valuable asset, it\u2019s odd to spend it working with people who\ndon\u2019t envision any long-term future together. If you can\u2019t count durable relationships\namong the fruits of your time at work, you haven\u2019t invested your time well\u2014even in\npurely financial terms.  \nFrom the start, I wanted PayPal to be tightly knit instead of transactional. I\nthought stronger relationships would make us not just happier and better at work\nbut also more successful in our careers even beyond PayPal."

        "text": "#### _Personal Sales_  \nMost sales are not particularly complex: average deal sizes might range between\n$10,000 and $100,000, and usually the CEO won\u2019t have to do all the selling himself.\nThe challenge here isn\u2019t about how to make any particular sale, but how to establish\na process by which a sales team of modest size can move the product to a wide  \naudience.  \nIn 2008, Box had a good way for companies to store their data safely and\naccessibly in the cloud. But people didn\u2019t know they needed such a thing\u2014cloud\ncomputing hadn\u2019t caught on yet. That summer, Blake was hired as Box\u2019s third\nsalesperson to help change that. Starting with small groups of users who had the\nmost acute file sharing problems, Box\u2019s sales reps built relationships with more and\nmore users in each client company. In 2009, Blake sold a small Box account to the\nStanford Sleep Clinic, where researchers needed an easy, secure way to store\nexperimental data logs. Today the university offers a Stanford-branded Box account  \nto every one of its students and faculty members, and Stanford Hospital runs on Box.\nIf it had started off by trying to sell the president of the university on an enterprisewide solution, Box would have sold nothing. A complex sales approach would have\nmade Box a forgotten startup failure; instead, personal sales made it a multibillion\ndollar business.  \nSometimes the product itself is a kind of distribution. ZocDoc is a Founders Fund\nportfolio company that helps people find and book medical appointments online.\nThe company charges doctors a few hundred dollars per month to be included in its\nnetwork. With an average deal size of just a few thousand dollars, ZocDoc needs lots\nof salespeople\u2014so many that they have an internal recruiting team to do nothing\nbut hire more. But making personal sales to doctors doesn\u2019t just bring in revenue; by\nadding doctors to the network, salespeople make the product more valuable to\nconsumers (and more consumer users increases its appeal to doctors)."
